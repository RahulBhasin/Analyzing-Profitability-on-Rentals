# Analyzing-Profitability-on-Rentals
Analyzing Profitability on short Term Rentals using Air BnB and Zillow data.

**Problem Statement:** AirBnB wants to buy properties in New York from Zillow listings data for short term rentals. We have to help AirBnB decide which zipcodes would be most profitable to invest in. One assumption made here is that the occupancy rante of the AirBnB is 75% and they are interested in buying properties with 2 bedrooms only. 

**Data:** Data is sourced from:
[Zillow Group, Inc. (2016)](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)
[AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

**Prgramming:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplot, plotnine). 

**what this notebook includes:**
- Scalable functions for Cleaning and transforming Data
- Analyzing data and comparing Neighbourhoods with Visualizations
- Comparison of Break even time and YoY profits for different zipcodes
- Final Recommendations
